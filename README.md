This project provides a tutoring application that can be used by the Oculus Quest 2 to create
  a virtual reality environment for tutoring use. A new system is needed to change the
  dynamics of how tutoring is presented online, from the accessibility of the resource, to
  keeping students engaged, and offering them the best learning experience. The Oculus Quest 2
  offers technologies help the development of online education: 6DoF, hand tracking and
  lip sync will allow the users to have meaningful physical interaction, while also feeling each
  otherâ€™s presence as if they were sitting in the same room.
