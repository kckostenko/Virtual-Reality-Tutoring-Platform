This project provides a tutoring application that can be used by the Oculus Quest 2 to create
  a virtual reality environment for tutoring, or classroom use. A multitude of institutions are
  becoming the main source of education due to Covid-19 and a new shift and view on online learning
  is occurring. This shift illustrated the limitations of communication through flat screens.
  Professors and tutors found themselves limited as they were presented as a 2D image to their 
  students, unable to make demonstrations, or have engaging sessions. A new system is needed to 
  change the dynamics of how classes are presented online in order to catch the attention of 
  students, keep them active, and offer them the best learning experience. The Oculus Quest 2
  offers technologies that will help the development of online education: 6DoF, hand tracking and
  lip sync will allow the users to have meaningful physical interaction, while also feeling each
  otherâ€™s presence as if they were sitting in the same room.
